	About:
		This solar-pp just for april fools joke, not intended to be fully fledged pursuits
		It have basics pp that you can use, i cannot guaranteed would be work 100% but yea
		This has been nice project for me, because of me keeping resetting this shit when
		imo the structure seems shit, but here we are!

	Features:
		- No login/Register
		- No saving system
		- Great lobby system
		- Basic Police Pursuits
		- Follows UNIX Philisophy that says 
			"Make each program do one thing well".
			"To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new 'features'."
